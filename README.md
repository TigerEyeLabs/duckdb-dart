## Installation

DuckDB.dart is available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_duckdb). Add it to your project as follows:

### For Flutter Projects

Run this command:

```bash
$ flutter pub add dart_duckdb
```

This updates your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_duckdb: ^1.2.0
```

### For Dart Projects

Run this command:

```bash
$ dart pub add dart_duckdb
```

This updates your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_duckdb: ^1.2.0
```

Download the latest duckdb release from [duckdb.org](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases).

In your dart code, tell the framework where the duckdb binary.

```dart
  open.overrideFor(
      OperatingSystem.macOS, 'path/to/libduckdb.dylib');
```

### Import it

Now you can use the package:

```dart
import 'package:dart_duckdb/dart_duckdb.dart';
```

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to start using DuckDB.dart:

```dart
import 'package:dart_duckdb/dart_duckdb.dart';

void main() {
  final db = duckdb.open(":memory:");
  final conn = db.connect();

  conn.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR)");
  conn.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')");

  final result = conn.query("SELECT * FROM users");
  for (final row in result.fetchAll()) {
    print(row);
  }

  conn.close();
  db.close();
}
```

This demonstrates opening a database, creating a table, inserting data, querying it, and closing resources.

### Querying Data

Execute SQL queries and process results easily:

```dart
final result = conn.query("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id > 0");
for (final row in result.fetchAll()) {
  print('ID: ${row['id']}, Name: ${row['name']}');
}
```

## Advanced Examples

### Querying a Parquet File

Query Parquet files directly without loading them into the database:

```dart
final result = conn.query("SELECT * FROM 'data/large_dataset.parquet' LIMIT 10");
for (final row in result.fetchAll()) {
    print(row);
}
```

### Using Window Functions

Perform advanced analytics with window functions:

```dart
conn.execute("CREATE TABLE sales (id INTEGER, amount DECIMAL, date DATE)");
conn.execute("INSERT INTO sales VALUES (1, 100.0, '2023-01-01'), (2, 150.0, '2023-01-02'), (3, 200.0, '2023-01-03')");

final result = conn.query("""
  SELECT id, amount, date,
         SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_total
  FROM sales
""");
for (final row in result.fetchAll()) {
  print('ID: ${row['id']}, Amount: ${row['amount']}, Date: ${row['date']}, Running Total: ${row['running_total']}');
}
```

### Working with CSV Files

Query CSV files directly:

```dart
final result = conn.query("SELECT * FROM 'data/sales_data.csv' WHERE quantity > 10");
for (final row in result.fetchAll()) {
  print(row);
}
```
